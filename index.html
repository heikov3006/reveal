					<p>The sport of drifting originated in Japan, where over the years it evolved from an underground movement 
						into a socially acceptable spectator magnet on international race tracks. In addition to Japan with the 
						D1 GP Series, the impressive art of lateral movement has spread from America (Formula D) to Europe. 
						In Germany, the first drift challenge made its debut in 1999 as part of the sport auto Tuner GP at the 
						Hockenheimring, which is still one of the top drift events on the annual racing calendar.</p>
